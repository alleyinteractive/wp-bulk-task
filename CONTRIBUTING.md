# Contributing to WP Bulk Task

Thank you for your interest in contributing to WP Bulk Task.

Read our
[Code of Conduct](https://github.com/alleyinteractive/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
to keep our community approachable and respectable.

In this guide you will get an overview of the contribution workflow from opening
an issue, creating a PR, reviewing, and merging the PR.

Use the table of contents icon on the top left corner of this document to get to
a specific section of this guide quickly.

## New Contributor Guide

To get an overview of the project, read the [README](README.md).

Here are some resources to help you get started with open source contributions:

- [Set up Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git)
- [GitHub flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow)
- [Collaborating with pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests)

## Getting Started

### Issues

#### Create a New Issue

If you see a problem or an opportunity to create a new feature,
[search if an issue already exists](https://github.com/alleyinteractive/wp-bulk-task/issues).

If a related issue doesn't exist, you can
[open a new issue](https://github.com/alleyinteractive/wp-bulk-task/issues/new).

#### Solve an Issue

If you would like to help solve an existing issue navigate to the
[list of open issues](https://github.com/alleyinteractive/wp-bulk-task/issues)
and choose one that interests you.

### Making Changes

#### Branching Workflow

If you are a member of Alley, you can create a new feature branch in this repo
according to our branch naming conventions. If you are not a member of Alley,
you should first fork this repository, then make your changes in a branch on
your fork. In either case, once you have completed your changes, create a pull
request against the `main` branch of this repository.

#### Preparing Your Local Environment

Set up the project according to the instructions in the
[From Source section of the README](README.md).

#### Commit Your Update

Commit the changes once you are happy with them. Once your changes are ready,
don't forget to self-review to speed up the review process. The self-review
should ensure that all automated tests and linting checks pass. See the
[GitHub Workflows directory](.github/workflows) for a list of all automated
tests that are executed when a PR is created and ensure that they pass locally
before creating your PR.

#### Pull Request

When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a
PR.

- Add a description of what the change does.
- Don't forget to
	[link your PR to an issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue)
	if you are solving one.
- Enable the checkbox to
	[allow maintainer edits](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork)
	so the branch can be updated for a merge. Once you submit your PR, an Alley
	team member will review your proposal. We may ask questions or request
	additional information.
- We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using
	[suggested changes](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request)
	or pull request comments. You can apply suggested changes directly through the
	UI. You can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your
	branch.
- As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as
	[resolved](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request#resolving-conversations).
- If you run into any merge issues, check out this
	[git tutorial](https://github.com/skills/resolve-merge-conflicts) to help you
	resolve merge conflicts and other issues.

#### Your PR is Merged!

Congratulations! The Alley team thanks you.

Once your PR is merged, your contributions will be publicly available on the
`main` branch of the library and included in a future tagged version and you will
be added to the contributors list.
