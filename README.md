# WP-CLI Bulk Task

[![Readme Standard Spec Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/readme%20style-standard-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/RichardLitt/standard-readme)

A library to assist with running performant bulk tasks against posts via WP-CLI.

## Background

This package provides a library to make it easier to run bulk tasks against a
WordPress database using WP-CLI in a performant way. It includes functionality
to search through a WordPress database for posts using WP_Query-style arguments
and keeps a cursor of its location within the database in case it is interrupted
and needs to start again.


## Releases

This package is released via Packagist for installation via Composer. It follows
semantic versioning conventions.


### Install

Requires Composer and PHP >= 8.0. Must be used in a WP-CLI command context.


### Use

Install this package via Composer:

```sh
composer require alleyinteractive/wp-cli-bulk-task
```

Ensure that the Composer autoloader is loaded into your project:

```php
require_once __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';
```

Then use the class in your custom CLI command:

```php
class My_Custom_CLI_Command extends WP_CLI_Command {

	/**
	 * Replace all instances of 'apple' with 'banana' in post content.
	 *
	 * ## OPTIONS
	 *
	 * [--dry-run]
	 * : If present, no updates will be made.
	 *
	 * [--rewind]
	 * : Resets the cursor so the next time the command is run it will start from the beginning.
	 *
	 * ## EXAMPLES
	 *
	 *     wp my-custom-cli-command bananaify
	 *
	 * @subcommand bananaify
	 */
	public function bananaify( $args, $assoc_args ) {
		$bulk_task = new \Alley_Interactive\WP_CLI_Bulk_Task\Bulk_Task( 'bananaify' );

		// Handle rewind requests.
		if ( ! empty( $assoc_args['rewind'] ) ) {
			$bulk_task->cursor->reset();
			WP_CLI::log( __( 'Rewound the cursor. Run again without the --rewind flag to process posts.', 'my-textdomain' ) );
			return;
		}

		// Set up and run the bulk task.
		$dry_run = ! empty( $assoc_args['dry-run'] );
		$bulk_task->run(
			[
				'post_status' => 'publish',
				'post_type'   => 'post',
				'tax_query'   => [
					[
						'field'    => 'slug',
						'taxonomy' => 'category',
						'terms'    => 'fruit',
					],
				],
			],
			function( $post_id ) use ( $dry_run ) {
				$post = get_post( $post_id );
				if ( false !== strpos( $post->post_content, 'apple' ) ) {
					$new_value = str_replace( 'apple', 'banana', $post->post_content );
					if ( $dry_run ) {
						WP_CLI::log( 'Old post_content: ' . $post->post_content );
						WP_CLI::log( 'New post_content: ' . $new_value );
					} else {
						$post->post_content = $new_value;
						wp_update_post( $post );
					}
				}
			}
		);
	}
}
```

## Project Structure

Here, provide an overview of the project structure and link to internal READMEs or wikis the team has setup that provide more detailed or nuanced project architecture.

If the project is intricate, consider including graphics. If you assume structural conventions, state them here, eg:

- We store code we don't want to deploy in `/no-deploy`
- We manage all third-party plugins via composer dependencies


## Third-Party Dependencies

Here, provide and link third-party dependencies outside those covered by a simple [install](#install) above. These might include links to a third-party SSO provider, a required license, or specific packages or libraries. For every dependency, include an overview of the purpose and instructions to manage or learn more about the integration. This is fine to summarize or link internally (eg. to a GitHub [wiki](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/documenting-your-project-with-wikis/about-wikis)), but be certain to include whether these are optional or required.


## Related Efforts

If your project requires, depends, extends, or competes with alternate projects worth noting, link them here, eg:

- Built with ðŸ’Œ  via the [mantle](https://mantle.alley.com/) framework


## Maintainers

For open source projects (public repositories), include GitHub handles of individuals or teams, or include a generic link to the [Alley Interactive](https://github.com/alleyinteractive) organization with a hashtag `#campteam`, eg:

- [Alley Interactive](https://github.com/alleyinteractive) #mops

It is also acceptable to break out responsibilities to individual GitHub handles or organizations if appropriate, eg:

- Deployment [@benpbolton](https://github.com/benpbolton)

Unless otherwise directed, include an Alley branded logo block for internal and external marketing.
