# WP Bulk Task

[![Readme Standard Spec Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/readme%20style-standard-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/RichardLitt/standard-readme)

A library to assist with running performant bulk tasks against WordPress posts.

## Background

This package provides a library to make it easier to run bulk tasks against a
WordPress database in a performant way. It includes functionality to search
through a WordPress database for posts using WP_Query-style arguments and keeps
a cursor of its location within the database in case it is interrupted and needs
to start again.


## Releases

This package is released via Packagist for installation via Composer. It follows
semantic versioning conventions.


### Install

Requires Composer and PHP >= 8.0.


### Use

Install this package via Composer:

```sh
composer require alleyinteractive/wp-bulk-task
```

Ensure that the Composer autoloader is loaded into your project:

```php
require_once __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';
```

Then use the class in your custom CLI command:

```php
class My_Custom_CLI_Command extends WP_CLI_Command {

	/**
	 * Replace all instances of 'apple' with 'banana' in post content.
	 *
	 * ## OPTIONS
	 *
	 * [--dry-run]
	 * : If present, no updates will be made.
	 *
	 * [--rewind]
	 * : Resets the cursor so the next time the command is run it will start from the beginning.
	 *
	 * ## EXAMPLES
	 *
	 *     wp my-custom-cli-command bananaify
	 *
	 * @subcommand bananaify
	 */
	public function bananaify( $args, $assoc_args ) {
		$bulk_task = new \Alley_Interactive\WP_Bulk_Task\Bulk_Task(
			'bananaify',
			new \Alley_Interactive\WP_Bulk_Task\Progress\PHP_CLI_Progress_Bar(
				__( 'Bulk Task: remove_broken_links', 'my-textdomain' )
			)
		);

		// Handle rewind requests.
		if ( ! empty( $assoc_args['rewind'] ) ) {
			$bulk_task->cursor->reset();
			WP_CLI::log( __( 'Rewound the cursor. Run again without the --rewind flag to process posts.', 'my-textdomain' ) );
			return;
		}

		// Set up and run the bulk task.
		$dry_run = ! empty( $assoc_args['dry-run'] );
		$bulk_task->run(
			[
				'post_status' => 'publish',
				'post_type'   => 'post',
				'tax_query'   => [
					[
						'field'    => 'slug',
						'taxonomy' => 'category',
						'terms'    => 'fruit',
					],
				],
			],
			function( $post_id ) use ( $dry_run ) {
				$post = get_post( $post_id );
				if ( false !== strpos( $post->post_content, 'apple' ) ) {
					$new_value = str_replace( 'apple', 'banana', $post->post_content );
					if ( $dry_run ) {
						WP_CLI::log( 'Old post_content: ' . $post->post_content );
						WP_CLI::log( 'New post_content: ' . $new_value );
					} else {
						$post->post_content = $new_value;
						wp_update_post( $post );
					}
				}
			}
		);
	}
}
```
